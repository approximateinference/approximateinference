In recent years, there have been numerous advances in probabilistic machine learning and approximate inference, which have enabled applications to increasingly challenging scenarios involving complex probabilistic models and large datasets.
The 7th Symposium on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference (AABI) will discuss this impact of probabilistic methods, and connections with other fields.
We encourage submissions that relate probabilistic methods to the fields of deep learning, reinforcement learning, causal inference, decision processes, compression, or differential privacy, among others.
We also encourage submissions that contribute to connecting different probabilistic methods and/or approximate inference methods.


This year we will run three submission tracks:

- a **Proceedings Track**, for full research papers of up to 12 content pages,
- a **Workshop Track**, for extended abstracts of 3-6 content pages, and
- a **Fast Track**, for recently accepted papers at selected venues.
