In recent years, advances in probabilistic machine learning and approximate inference methods have enabled the development of state-of-the-art methods across many domains, such as in generative modeling, AI-driven scientific discovery, and AI safety. 

The 7th Symposium on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference (AABI) will discuss this impact of probabilistic methods, and connections with other fields in machine learning and across the sciences. 
For example, we encourage submissions that relate probabilistic methods to:

- deep learning,
- reinforcement learning,
- NLP,
- causal inference,
- decision-making under uncertainty,
- compression,
- AI safety,
- ML systems,
- AI for science, and
- causal inference.

We also encourage submissions that contribute to the foundations of probabilistic machine learning and machine learning theory.

This year we will run three submission tracks:

- a **Proceedings Track**, for full research papers of up to 12 content pages,
- a **Workshop Track**, for extended abstracts of 3-6 content pages, and
- a **Fast Track**, for recently accepted papers at selected venues.
