In recent years, there have been numerous advances in approximate inference methods, which have enabled Bayesian inference in increasingly challenging scenarios involving complex probabilistic models and large datasets.
The 6th Symposium on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference (AABI) will discuss this impact of Bayesian inference, connecting approximate inference methods with other fields.
We encourage submissions that relate Bayesian inference to the fields of deep learning, reinforcement learning, causal inference, decision processes, Bayesian compression, or differential privacy, among others.
We also encourage submissions that contribute to connecting different approximate inference methods.

This year we will run three submission tracks:

- a **Proceedings Track**, for full research papers of up to 12 content pages,
- a **Workshop Track**, for extended abstracts of 3-6 content pages, and
- a **Fast Track**, for recently accepted papers at selected venues.

## Location and Registration

The symposium will take place in the TU the Sky room on the 11th floor of the TU Wien building in downtown Vienna (maps link).

Registration for in-person attendance is free but will be limited.
Click here to register!
All accepted papers must have at least one author attending in person.
If you are unable to register, feel free to sign up on the waiting list.
We will contact you if more slots become available.
Given the limited seats, please cancel your registration if you know you will not be able to attend in-person.
